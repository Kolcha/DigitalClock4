Digital Clock 4 - beautiful clock with plugins
https://digitalclock4.sourceforge.io/

Quick start
-----------
Nothing special required to start using this clock. Just launch it  and  enjoy!
When it starts,  apart the clock itself, small tray icon appears  (where system
tray is available). Tray icon appearance depends on  operating system,  in most
cases it is black, but on  Windows 10  and  macOS  with  dark panel theme it is
white. This tray icon can be used  at least to call clock configuration dialog.
Also configuration dialog  can be  called using context menu,  which appears on
right click on clock. In environments without system tray this is only  the way
to call configuration dialog. But be ware: when  "transparent for mouse" option
is enabled, you will be unable to click on clock!  All clicks will pass through
the clock.  In such case  manual configuration editing will be required.  Clock
configuration locations listed below.

Windows (installer):
system registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Nick Korotysh/Digital Clock

Windows (portable):
file 'settings.ini' alongside the executable (in clock folder)

Linux:
file: ~/.config/Nick Korotysh/Digital Clock.conf

macOS:
file: ~/Library/Preferences/net.sourceforge.digitalclock4.Digital Clock.plist

Deleting configuration files is totally safe, this only  leads to  reset to the
default configuration. This is may be useful when something goes  wrong.  There
is no more way to reset settings.
