Digital Clock 4
===============

Looking for the replacement for boring system clock? If it is true, this clock may be right for you! This pretty small software has a lot of customization options + several plugins which can extend its functionality or slightly change behavior or appearance. Give it a try, even if you will not like it, it can be uninstalled very easily.

Key features:

* supports skins or any font can be used instead of skin
* any color or even texture can be applied to the skin
* Retina (HiDPI) displays ready
* can be shown on multiple monitors
* all main OSes are supported: Windows, macOS, Linux

Minimum supported OS version may vary from release to release and changed depending on used compiler and Qt version.
I have no plans to stuck on some compiler or Qt version just to support some ancient system!

Few screenshots, latest news, system requirements can be found at [project home page](https://digitalclock4.sourceforge.io/).

Also there is [mini wiki](https://sourceforge.net/p/digitalclock4/wiki/) (really mini :) ) exists, where you can find [how to create your own skin](https://sourceforge.net/p/digitalclock4/wiki/How%20to%20create%20skin/) for this clock (it is really very easy, no any special skills are required), [how to translate into your language](https://sourceforge.net/p/digitalclock4/wiki/How%20to%20translate/) or even how to build sources.

**Please, [help to translate][transifex-link]! Few languages where requested, I added them to [transifex project][transifex-link], feel free to join it and translate. Nothing required from my side, I configured project that anyone can be added as translator automatically. Only one thing is required - you must have transifex account (GitHub and few other accounts can be used to login it). Translations to Korean and Chinese are really appreciated.**

Any bug reports, notes, suggestions and anything else can be sent through the [tickets](https://sourceforge.net/p/digitalclock4/tickets/) or directly to me. My contact information can be be found in "About" dialog.

Important Note
--------------

Repository at [GitHub](https://github.com/Kolcha/DigitalClock4) is **just a read-only mirror**, existing mainly for public build servers. It is not always up to date, I update it only when I think it is important, but be sure it's always up to date when release happens. My **main repository** located at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/digitalclock4/code/), so latest code can be found only here.
